    description: SSO is used in APIs to authenticate users across multiple applications, enhancing user experience and security. It is implemented using various protocols like SAML, OAuth, and JWT. API endpoints are used to manage SSO configurations and handle SSO flows.
  bestPractices:
    - Use secure authentication methods and protocols like OAuth and JWT.
    - Ensure proper session management with parameters like 'session_lifetime' and 'idle_session_lifetime'.
    - Test the SSO setup thoroughly to verify the connection and setup.

# Single Sign-On  Glossary Entry

**Single Sign-On ** is a user authentication process that allows users to access multiple applications with a single set of login credentials, such as a username and password. This approach is particularly beneficial in environments where users need to access various services, enhancing user experience and security by minimizing the number of credentials they must manage and remember.

## Understanding Single Sign-On  Concepts

Single Sign-On  enables users to authenticate across multiple systems and applications using one set of credentials managed by a central service. This central management reduces password fatigue, decreases the risk of phishing attacks, and simplifies the user experience. SSO is commonly implemented using standards like **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** and **Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)**, making it a vital component in modern API development.

## API vs SSO: Key Differences Explained

While both **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)** and **SSO (Single Sign-On)** play crucial roles in software development, they serve different purposes. APIs facilitate communication between software applications without user intervention, while SSO focuses on user authentication, allowing users to access multiple applications with a single set of credentials. Understanding the distinction between API vs SSO is essential for developers looking to implement secure and efficient authentication methods.

## Implementing Okta SSO Integration

**Okta** is a leading identity management service that provides robust SSO capabilities. To integrate **Okta SSO**, developers must register their application with Okta, configure authentication settings, and implement the Okta SDK or API calls in their application. This setup involves redirecting authentication requests to Okta, which handles user login and returns an authentication token upon successful login.

```javascript
// Example of integrating Okta SSO in a Node.js application
const OktaJwtVerifier = require('@okta/jwt-verifier');

const oktaJwtVerifier = new OktaJwtVerifier({
  issuer: 'https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default',
  clientId: '{yourClientId}',
  assertClaims: {
    aud: 'api://default',
  },
});

// Middleware to verify tokens from Okta
function authenticationRequired(req, res, next) {
  const authHeader = req.headers.authorization || '';
  const match = authHeader.match(/Bearer (.+)/);

  if (!match) {
    res.status(401);
    return next('Unauthorized');
  }

  const accessToken = match[1];
  oktaJwtVerifier.verifyAccessToken(accessToken)
    .then((jwt) => {
      req.jwt = jwt;
      next();
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      res.status(401).send(err.message);
    });
}
```

## Using Okta SSO API for Authentication

The **Okta SSO API** provides endpoints for managing user authentication and sessions. Developers can utilize these APIs to programmatically log in and log out users, as well as manage user sessions. The API employs standard **OAuth 2.0** and **OpenID Connect** protocols to secure and manage access to user data, making it an essential tool for API development.

## AWS SSO API: A Comprehensive Overview

The **AWS SSO API** allows developers to integrate AWS Single Sign-On features into their applications. This API provides methods for managing SSO entities, including users, groups, and permissions. It also supports the automation of user provisioning and deprovisioning processes, simplifying access management to AWS resources across multiple accounts.

## REST API SSO Authentication Techniques

When implementing SSO in **REST APIs**, developers can leverage various authentication techniques such as **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**, **OAuth**, and **SAML assertions**. These methods involve sending the token or assertion received from the SSO provider in the HTTP Authorization header of API requests. The API then validates the token to authenticate the request.

```http
GET /api/resource HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

In this setup, the API server must validate the token against the issuer's public keys to ensure its integrity and authenticity before granting access to the requested resources.

By understanding and implementing **Single Sign-On **, developers can enhance security and streamline user access across multiple applications, making it a critical aspect of modern API development.
