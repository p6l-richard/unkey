# API Gateways: A Comprehensive Overview for Developers

API gateways are critical components in modern application architectures, particularly in microservices environments. They serve as the front door for all API calls, enabling applications to communicate with each other and with external services. This glossary entry delves into the essential aspects of API gateways, including their role in microservices, key features of popular API gateway products, and comparisons with load balancers.

## What is an API Gateway in Microservices?

In a microservices architecture, an API gateway is responsible for request routing, composition, and protocol translation. Each microservice performs a specific function, and the API gateway acts as a centralized entry point to manage and secure these interactions. By directing requests to the appropriate services and composing data responses for clients, the API gateway enhances the efficiency and reliability of the application.

## Key Features of Popular API Gateway Products

When exploring **API gateway products**, developers will find a variety of features that enhance functionality:

- **Load Balancing:** Distributes incoming API traffic across multiple backend services, improving load handling and fault tolerance.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Validates API calls by ensuring they have valid credentials and appropriate permissions.
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevents API abuse by limiting the number of requests a user can make within a specified timeframe.
- **Caching:** Improves response times by storing copies of frequently accessed data.
- **API Orchestration:** Facilitates request routing to multiple backend services to create a single, aggregate response.

## API Gateways vs Load Balancers: Key Differences

While both API gateways and load balancers manage network traffic, their core functionalities differ significantly:

- **Purpose:** Load balancers distribute traffic to ensure that no single server is overwhelmed. In contrast, API gateways manage API traffic, route requests, enforce policies, and provide additional functionalities like caching and authentication.
- **Scope:** Load balancers operate at the network transport layer, while API gateways function at the application layer, handling specific API protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket.

## Examples of API Gateways in Action

Consider a mobile banking application that utilizes various microservices for functions like balance checks, money transfers, and user authentication. An **API gateway** can effectively manage these requests by directing them to the appropriate services, providing a seamless integration layer that enhances security and improves user experience.

## A Comprehensive List of API Gateways

Here is a list of some widely used **API gateways**:

- **Amazon API Gateway**
- **Kong**
- **Apigee**
- **Microsoft Azure API Management**
- **Google Cloud Endpoints**

These **popular API gateways** are designed to meet the diverse needs of developers and organizations.

## Exploring Open Source API Gateways

For those interested in flexibility and customization, **open source API gateways** offer significant advantages over proprietary solutions. Notable examples include:

- **Kong:** Built on NGINX, it offers high performance and scalability.
- **Tyk:** Provides a rich set of features with a focus on API management and analytics.
- **KrakenD:** Specializes in high-performance API gateway solutions, ideal for microservices architectures.

These open source options are particularly beneficial for organizations looking to tailor their gateway layer to meet specific requirements without the constraints of licensed software.

In summary, understanding **what an API gateway is in microservices** and its various functionalities is essential for developers working with modern application architectures. By leveraging the right **API gateway products**, developers can enhance their applications' performance, security, and scalability.
